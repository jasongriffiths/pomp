\details{
  The data are from "population I", a control culture in one of A. J. Nicholson's experiments with the Australian sheep-blowfly \emph{Lucilia cuprina}.
  The experiment is described on pp. 163--4 of Nicholson (1957).
  Unlimited quantities of larval food were provided;
  the adult food supply (ground liver) was constant at 0.4g per day.
  The data were taken from the table provided by Brillinger et al. (1980).

  The models are discrete delay equations:
  \deqn{R(t+1) \sim \mathrm{Poisson}(P N(t-\tau) \exp{(-N(t-\tau)/N_{0})} e(t+1) {\Delta}t)}{%
    R[t+1] ~ Poisson(P N[t-tau] exp(-N[t-tau]/N0) e[t+1] dt)}
  \deqn{S(t+1) \sim \mathrm{binomial}(N(t),\exp{(-\delta \epsilon(t+1) {\Delta}t)})}{%
    S[t+1] ~ binomial(N[t],exp(-delta eps[t+1] dt))}
  \deqn{N(t) = R(t)+S(t)}{N[t]=R[t]+S[t]}
  where \eqn{e(t)}{e[t]} and \eqn{\epsilon(t)}{eps[t]} are Gamma-distributed i.i.d. random variables with mean 1 and variances \eqn{{\sigma_p^2}/{{\Delta}t}}{sigma.p^2/dt}, \eqn{{\sigma_d^2}/{{\Delta}t}}{sigma.d^2/dt}, respectively.
  \code{blowflies1} has a timestep (\eqn{{\Delta}t}{dt}) of 1 day, and \code{blowflies2} has a timestep of 2 days.
  The process model in \code{blowflies1} thus corresponds exactly to that studied by Wood (2010).
  The measurement model in both cases is taken to be
  \deqn{y(t) \sim \mathrm{negbin}(N(t),1/\sigma_y^2)}{y[t] ~ negbin(N[t],1/sigma.y^2)}, i.e., the observations are assumed to be negative-binomially distributed with mean \eqn{N(t)}{N[t]} and variance \eqn{N(t)+(\sigma_y N(t))^2}{N[t]+(sigma.y N[t])^2}.
