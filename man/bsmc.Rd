\title{Liu and West Bayesian Particle Filter}
\description{
  Generates draws from the posterior distribution for the parameters using the Liu and West algorithm.
  \code{bsmc} gives draws from the posterior.
}
\usage{
\S4method{bsmc}{pomp}(object, params, Np, est, smooth = 0.1,
     ntries = 1, tol = 1e-17, lower = -Inf, upper = Inf, seed = NULL,
     verbose = getOption("verbose"), max.fail = 0,
     transform = FALSE, \dots)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{
    An object of class \code{pomp} or inheriting class \code{pomp}.
  }
  \item{params, Np}{
    Specifications for the prior distribution of particles.
    See details below.
  }
  \item{est}{
    Names of the rows of \code{params} that are to be estimated.
    No updates will be made to the other parameters.
    If \code{est} is not specified, all parameters for which there is variation in \code{params} will be estimated.
  }
  \item{smooth}{
    Kernel density smoothing parameters.
    The compensating shrinkage factor will be \code{sqrt(1-smooth^2)}.
    Thus, \code{smooth=0} means that no noise will be added to parameters.
    Generally, the value of \code{smooth} should be chosen close to 0 (i.e., \code{shrink~0.1}).
  }
  \item{ntries}{
    Number of draws from \code{rprocess} per particle used to estimate the expected value of the state process at time \code{t+1} given the state and parameters at time \code{t}.
  }
  \item{tol}{
    Particles with log likelihood below \code{tol} are considered to be \dQuote{lost}.
    A filtering failure occurs when, at some time point, all particles are lost.
    When all particles are lost, the conditional log likelihood at that time point is set to be \code{log(tol)}.
  }
  \item{lower, upper}{
    optional; lower and upper bounds on the priors.
    This is useful in case there are box constraints satisfied by the priors.
    The posterior is guaranteed to lie within these bounds.
  }
  \item{seed}{
    optional; an object specifying if and how the random number generator should be initialized (\sQuote{seeded}).
    If \code{seed} is an integer, it is passed to \code{set.seed} prior to any simulation and is returned as the \dQuote{seed} element of the return list.
    By default, the state of the random number generator is not changed and the value of \code{.Random.seed} on the call is stored in the \dQuote{seed} element of the return list.
  }
  \item{verbose}{
    logical; if \code{TRUE}, print diagnostic messages.
  }
  \item{max.fail}{
    The maximum number of filtering failures allowed.
    If the number of filtering failures exceeds this number, execution will terminate with an error.
  }
  \item{transform}{
    logical;
    if \code{TRUE}, the algorithm operates on the transformed scale.
  }
  \item{\dots}{
    currently ignored.
  }
}
\value{
  An object of class \dQuote{bsmcd.pomp}.
  The \dQuote{params} slot of this object will hold the parameter posterior medians.
  The slots of this class include:
  \item{post}{
    A matrix containing draws from the approximate posterior distribution.
  }
  \item{prior}{
    A matrix containing draws from the prior distribution (identical to \code{params} on call).
  }
  \item{eff.sample.size}{
    A vector containing the effective number of particles at each time point.
  }
  \item{smooth}{
    The smoothing parameter used (see above).
  }
  \item{seed}{
    The state of the random number generator at the time \code{bsmc} was called.
    If the argument \code{seed} was specified, this is a copy;
    if not, this is the internal state of the random number generator at the time of call.
  }
  \item{nfail}{
    The number of filtering failures encountered.
  }
  \item{cond.log.evidence}{
    A vector containing the conditional log evidence scores at each time point.
  }
  \item{log.evidence}{
    The estimated log evidence.
  }
  \item{weights}{
    The resampling weights for each particle.
  }
}
\details{
  There are two ways to specify the prior distribution of particles.
  If \code{params} is unspecified or is a named vector, \code{Np} draws are made from the prior distribution, as specified by \code{\link{rprior}}.
  Alternatively, \code{params} can be specified as an \code{npars} x \code{Np} matrix (with rownames).
